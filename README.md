# Embedded Systems Developer

## About Me
My name is Saksham Srivastava, I'm an embedded systems developer with hands-on experience in STM32 microcontroller programming. I focus on bare-metal programming and building hardware drivers from scratch using C and register-level programming.

## Technical Skills

**Programming**
- C (embedded development, register-level programming)
- ARM Assembly (basic understanding)
- Bare-metal programming (no HAL libraries)

**Hardware**
- STM32F10x series microcontrollers
- ARM Cortex-M3 architecture
- GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI peripherals
- Interrupt systems and timers

**Tools**
- STM32CubeIDE / Keil ÂµVision
- Hardware debugging
- Version control (Git)

## Recent Projects

### Multi-Protocol Communication System
**STM32F10x | C | Bare Metal**
- Implemented SPI, I2C, and UART drivers from scratch
- Dual-channel support for each protocol
- Manual chip select control for SPI
- Configurable baud rates and clock speeds
- Interrupt-driven UART communication

### GPIO Driver Library
**STM32F10x | C | Hardware Abstraction**
- Custom GPIO driver with dynamic register access
- Support for all GPIO modes and configurations
- Pointer arithmetic for efficient memory access
- Multi-port support (GPIOA, GPIOB, GPIOC)

### Real-time Communication Bridge
**STM32F10x | C | Real-time Systems**
- Multi-UART bridge system with message routing
- Interrupt-driven data handling
- SysTick timer for precise timing
- Cross-channel communication between UART2/UART3

## Key Strengths
- **Register-level programming**: Direct peripheral control without HAL
- **Protocol implementation**: I2C, SPI, UART from scratch
- **Interrupt systems**: ISR design and real-time programming
- **Hardware abstraction**: Clean, reusable driver interfaces
- **Multi-peripheral coordination**: Managing multiple communication protocols

## What I'm Working On
- Advanced communication protocols (CAN bus, Ethernet)
- Real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS)
- Power management and optimization
- Industry coding standards and best practices

## Looking For
Opportunities to work on embedded systems projects where I can:
- Apply my bare-metal programming skills
- Work with communication protocols and real-time systems
- Contribute to hardware-software integration
- Learn from experienced developers
- Grow into senior embedded development roles
