# Embedded Systems Developer

## About Me
I'm an embedded systems enthusiast with hands-on experience in STM32 microcontroller programming. I enjoy working with low-level hardware programming and building functional embedded applications from scratch.

## Technical Skills

### Programming Languages
- **C** - Primary language for embedded development
- **Assembly** - Basic understanding for microcontroller programming

### Microcontrollers & Hardware
- **STM32F10x** - Hands-on experience with GPIO, interrupts, and timers
- **ARM Cortex-M** - Understanding of architecture and peripheral programming
- **Hardware debugging** - Experience with register-level programming

### Development Tools
- **STM32CubeIDE** / **Keil** - Familiar with embedded development environments
- **Hardware debugging** - Basic experience with debugging embedded systems

## Recent Projects

### STM32 GPIO Driver Library
**Technologies:** C, STM32F10x, Bare Metal Programming

A custom GPIO driver library for STM32F10x microcontrollers that I built from scratch:

- **GPIO Control**: Implemented functions for pin initialization, reading, writing, and toggling
- **Port Management**: Support for GPIOA, GPIOB, and GPIOC ports
- **Interrupt Handling**: External interrupt (EXTI) implementation with proper ISR
- **Timer Integration**: SysTick timer configuration for precise delays
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Created reusable functions for different GPIO configurations

**Key Features:**
- Direct register manipulation for optimal performance
- Support for different pin modes (input/output, push-pull/open-drain)
- Interrupt-driven state changes
- Millisecond-precision delays using SysTick

**What I Learned:**
- Register-level programming and memory-mapped I/O
- Interrupt service routine implementation
- Clock configuration and peripheral enabling
- Hardware abstraction layer design

## Code Quality & Approach

I focus on writing clean, functional code that works reliably. My current approach includes:
- Direct register manipulation for hardware control
- Functional programming style with clear function names
- Basic error handling and hardware initialization
- Practical solutions that get the job done

## Areas I'm Developing

I'm actively working to improve in these areas:
- More robust error handling and edge case management
- Advanced debugging techniques
- Code optimization and performance tuning
- Industry-standard coding practices and documentation
- Working with more complex peripheral interfaces (SPI, I2C, UART)

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking opportunities where I can:
- Apply my embedded C programming skills in real-world projects
- Learn from experienced developers and grow my technical abilities
- Work on interesting hardware projects and expand my microcontroller knowledge
- Contribute to meaningful embedded systems development

## Contact & Collaboration

I'm enthusiastic about embedded systems and always eager to learn new things. I believe in honest communication about my current skill level and am committed to continuous improvement.
